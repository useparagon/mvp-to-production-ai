# MVP to Prodution AI

## 1) Production-ready RAG
In this tutorial, we implemented a RAG app that can connect and sync to different file storage, document, and CRM integrations.
Once synced, our RAG chatbot could search across documents while respecting the native permissions of the data source - that means if you don't have access to a google drive file, you won't be able to retrieve context from that file.
Lastly Managed Sync webhooks ensure that record updates are captured.
